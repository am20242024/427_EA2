# 427_EA2
EA2 for wsu CPT_S_427


The deliverable was made in cpp. Instructions were to apply topics discussed in the webinar to make a program with assistance from IBM Bob in a hands on workshop using IBM Bob. My program was a file management system that would sort files by their extension type and then place them into a folder with other files of the same extension. I made the 
framework for the program by starting out with the methods and then used IBM Bob to help me code the functionality of the program. After obtaining permission I have attached 
the code file in the repo. 

Below are screenshots of the program sorting my directory for CPTS 427 and my participation in the webinar event
